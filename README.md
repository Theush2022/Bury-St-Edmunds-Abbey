### Structure Plane

The three pages allow users both see and read about what's available at the Abbey so they can make a decision on what they want to see and who to contact for a tours/questions.

### Skeleton Plane

Initially designed for desktop/laptop usage but adapted for mobile & tablet users also.


### Surface Plane

* Colors

I wanted the webiste to appear both welcoming and gentle with a light grey background #f5f3f4 but with some bold coloring for contrast. I used light-red #e5383b underlining the active pages on the navagation menu and for som styling on the sign up page. I went for a very dark grey #161a1d for the headers and text.

* Typography

I used two font types from https://fonts.google.com/ with pairing advice from https://www.fontpair.co/pairing/spectral-and-karla

**Spectral** (weight: 300)

## Version control

Two repositories were used for this websites development. Gitpod for local purposes and Github for a remot/background repository.

I managed the versions with the followung process:
- Repository created in Github
- I opened the repository in Gitpod and used this for development purposes.
- Files were added and developed in Gitpod.
- Using the following commands I pushed my work to the to GitHub repository:
    1. git add . - adds a change in the working directory to the staging area
    2. git commit -m "Commit message" - captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes
    3. git push - to upload local repository content to a remote repository

## Publish the project

Steps for deployment/publishing on the GitHub were as follow:
    
    1. "Settings" on the project repository
    2. "Pages" then scroll to source then ensure "Main" selected as branch then save.
    3. The website is then published and the link made available on the same Github page.
